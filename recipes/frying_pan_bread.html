    <h1>Odin, Yggdrasil, and the Quest for Knowledge</h1>

    <p>I know that I hung on a windswept tree</p>
       <p>nine long nights,</p> 
        <p>wounded with a spear, dedicated to Odin,</p> 
        <p>myself to myself,</p>
        <p>on that tree of which no man knows</p> 
        <p>from where its roots run.</p> 
        
        <p>With no bread did they refresh me nor a drink from a horn,</p>  
        <p>downwards I peered;</p>
        <p>I took up the runes, screaming I took them,</p> 
        <p>then I fell back from there. </p>

    <h2>Öland Frying Pan Bread</h2>
    
    <ul><li>200 grams of milk</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>500 grams of barley flour</li>
        <li>25 grams of yeast (optional)</li></ul>

    <h4>Instructions:</h4>
    
    <ol><li>Mix all the ingredients and knead the dough.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into 10 pieces.</li>
        <li>Roll out with a rolling pin.</li>
        <li>Bake without fat in a frying pan over an open flame or on the outdoor grill for about 1 ½ minutes on each side.</li></ol> 

<p>Actually, no yeast is needed at all. It is enough to take flour and water. You can use any flour you want (barley, wheat, rye) and mix it in a bowl together with water, but only enough water to make a dough that can be handled. These bread cakes can also be prepared on heated stones, directly on the stovetop or in a frying pan.</p>
