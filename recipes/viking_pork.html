    <h1>The History of Viking Food</h1>

    <p>We can never be for certain, the culinary expertise of our ancestors.  What did 
        they eat, how did they prepare it, and what did it taste like?  Fortunately, Archeologist and Food
        Historians do their best to fill in the gaps by collaborating.  This recipe is 
        courtesy of <i><b>Tasting History</b> with Max Miller</i> and is his take on <i><b>An Early Meal</b> by Daniel Serra 
        and Hanna Tunberg.</i>
   
    
    <h2>Viking Pork with Berry Sauce</h2>
    
    <ul>
        
        <li>1 lb (1/2 kg) pork tenderloin</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons (25 g) lard, or another oil</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups (125 g) chopped spring onion or leek</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons brown mustard seeds, roughly crushed</li>
        <li>1 lb (1/2 kg) fresh berries, whatever you like</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chopped mint</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (120 ml) water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (120 ml) mead*</li>
    
    </ul>

    <h4>Instructions:</h4>
    
    <ol>
        
        <li>Cook the tenderloin however you like. To braise it, preheat the oven to 325°F (160°C).</li>
        <li>Salt the pork well, then melt the lard in a pot. When it’s hot, sear the pork on all sides, about 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the pork and add the green onions or leeks and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the mead and water and stir to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Add the mint and mustard seed and bring to a simmer, then put the pork back in.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot and transfer it to the oven and cook for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the center of the pork reaches 145°F (63°C).</li>
        <li>Place the pot back on the stove and remove the pork to rest while you prepare the berry sauce.</li>
        <li>Add the berries to the pot with the braising liquid and bring it to a gentle simmer and cook for 7 to 8 minutes. Turn off the heat and mash the berries, then pour the sauce through a sieve, pressing out as much liquid as possible.</li>
        <li>Return the sieved sauce to the pot and simmer for another 5 to 7 minutes to reduce it.</li>
        <li>After the sauce has reduced and the tenderloin has rested, slice the pork and serve it forth with a healthy drizzle of the berry sauce and a glass of any leftover mead.</li>
